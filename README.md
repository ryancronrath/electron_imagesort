# Image Sort

Image Sort is a work in progress and a first attempt working with npm and electron.  The purpose of the application is to take a directory of images, review the EXIF data - if any, and sort the images into a folder based on the EXIF create date.


## Features

- Searches for EXIF data on the following file types
    - .JPG/JPEG
    - .NEF
    - .PNG


## Roadmap

- Additional sorting methods using regex to look at the file name and get the date.
